### Abstract
In this paper, I question the thematic emphasis of Brazilian Presidents and Chancellors during their inauguration speeches. The main objective is to know if the actors maintain a pattern of continuity when it comes to the prioritization of topics and categories or if they tend to minimize and to maximize mentions in a particular way. By means of Content Analysis and Text Mining, it was found a continuity in the sense that there are insignificant categories, regardless of the actor. There are also categories maintained repetitively important in every speech. Besides, when measures of associations and distance of words had been used, it was found clusters of actors in different levels of proximity. In this aspect, it is conspicuous the existence of a cohesive cluster between Chancellors, whereas Presidents tend to be in a sparser localization
